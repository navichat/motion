- **Migrated**: Mojo implementation with manual memory management
- **Performance**: Optimized for real-time motion processing
- **Files**: 
  - `weights/deephase_weights.npz` - Extracted PyTorch weights
  - `mojo/deephase_simple.mojo` - Mojo implementation

### 2. **DeepMimic RL Models** (Actor-Critic Networks)
- **Actor Network**: State→Action mapping (197→1024→512→36)
- **Critic Network**: State→Value estimation (197→1024→512→1)
- **Weights Extracted**: Stored in NPZ format for loading
- **Files**:
  - `weights/deepmimic_actor_weights.npz`
  - `weights/deepmimic_critic_weights.npz`

### 3. **RSMT Motion Transition System**
- **Analysis Complete**: Model architectures documented
- **StyleVAE**: Variational autoencoder for style vectors
- **TransitionNet**: Neural motion transitions
- **Status**: Ready for Mojo migration (Phase 2)
