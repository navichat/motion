## Migration Status

### Phase 1: Model Analysis and Conversion
- [x] Project structure setup
- [ ] PyTorch model analysis
- [ ] ONNX export scripts
- [ ] MAX model conversion
- [ ] Mojo wrapper implementation

### Phase 2: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Custom Mojo kernels
- [ ] Vectorized data processing
- [ ] Batched inference pipelines
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

### Phase 3: Integration and Deployment
- [ ] Training pipeline migration
- [ ] Web server integration
- [ ] Container deployment
- [ ] Monitoring and validation

## Target Systems

1. **DeepMimic** - Reinforcement learning for physics-based character animation
2. **RSMT** - Real-time stylized motion transition system
3. **Supporting Infrastructure** - Data processing, web servers, deployment

## Expected Performance Gains

- **Inference Speed**: 2-10x improvement over PyTorch
- **Memory Usage**: 20-40% reduction
- **Deployment**: Simplified single-container deployment
- **Hardware**: CPU/GPU agnostic execution

## Getting Started

1. Install Modular platform: `pip install modular`
2. Verify installation: `max --version && mojo --version`
3. Run migration scripts: `python scripts/migrate_models.py`
4. Validate results: `python validation/accuracy_tests.py`
