## ðŸš€ Development Status Update

### âœ… Phase 1 COMPLETED: Foundation Migration
**Location**: `/home/barberb/motion/dev/`

The Chat Interface's 3D avatar viewer has been successfully migrated to a new development environment with enhanced capabilities:

- **3D Viewer**: Modern React + Three.js implementation 
- **Avatar Support**: VRM character loading with caching
- **Animations**: JSON format playback with advanced controls
- **Environments**: Classroom, stage, studio, and outdoor scenes
- **API Server**: FastAPI with REST endpoints
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples

**Quick Start:**
```bash
cd /home/barberb/motion/dev/server
./start_dev.sh
# Open http://localhost:8081
```

### ðŸ”„ Phase 2 NEXT: RSMT Integration
Upcoming neural network integration for advanced motion synthesis:

- RSMT PyTorch models (DeepPhase, StyleVAE, TransitionNet)
- 100STYLE dataset support
- Real-time style transfer and motion generation
- WebSocket streaming for live updates

---

This workspace contains multiple projects related to motion capture, character animation, and AI-driven movement synthesis. The projects work together to provide a complete pipeline from motion data processing to real-time character animation.
